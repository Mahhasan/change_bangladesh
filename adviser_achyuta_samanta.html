                                        In addition, Prof. Samanta's philanthropic work, including providing healthcare, drinking water, and sanitation facilities to the underprivileged sections of society, further demonstrates his commitment to creating positive change. His experience and expertise would be valuable in advising an event aimed at finding and supporting change makers who are dedicated to creating a better world.
